Development Environment
-----------------------

If you want to work on aerofiles you should install the necessary dependencies
using pip, preferably in a virtual environment::

    $ python -m venv .env
    $ source .env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

You can run the testsuite with::

    $ make test

If you close the current shell, the virtual python environment will
also be deactivated. To continue working in the environment and using
the installed requirements, you must use this again::
  
    $ source .env/bin/activate

Building Docs

Make sure that you have checked out git submodules::

    $ git submodule update --init

Then build docs using Sphinx and Make::

   $ cd docs
   $ make html

The HTML output can be found in the `_build/html` directory.
